EFUP - Embedded Field Upgrade Program

Introduction
------------

The Embedded Field Update Program (or EFUP for short) is a scriptable
utility for flashing a system update to a target device.

It is meant to be placed into a ramdisk with update script(s) and optionally
update keys (if only trusted update files should be loaded).

Update scripts may be created using the LUA scripting language (and APIs)
and scripting commands described in this document.

Compiling
---------

The following development headers and libaries are required:

   - nspr (will be built if not found)
   - nss (will be built if not found)
   - zlib

EFUP may then be built with:

   ./autogen.sh && ./configure
   make

Cross-compiling
---------------

EFUP may be crossed-compiled for an embedded Linux system as follows:

   export CFLAGS='-march=armv7-a -mthumb-interwork -mfloat-abi=hard \
       -mfpu=neon -mtune=cortex-a9 -mno-unaligned-access --sysroot=$SYSROOT -g -O'
   export PKG_CONFIG_DIR=
   export PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=${SYSROOT}/usr/lib/pkgconfig:${SYSROOT}/usr/share/pkgconfig
   export PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR=${SYSROOT}
   ./autogen.sh && ./configure --host=arm-none-linux-gnueabi
   make

with SYSROOT, CFLAGS and --host set for your platform.

Scripting commands
------------------

efup:extract(<archive>, <folder>)

   The specified archive is loaded from the current update source (see
   efup:source) and extracted to the specified folder. Supported archive
   types are: .tar.bz2 and .tar.gz.

   Example: efup:extract("data.tar.bz2", "/data")

efup:format(<volume>)

   Format the specified volume (which shall not be mounted). The file-system
   type is determined from the previously parsed fstab file.

   Example: efup:format("/data")

efup:fstab(<fstab-file>)

   Load the volume list from the specified fstab(5) file. Note that only the
   first three fields are actually used by EFUP (namely fs_spec, fs_file and
   fs_vfstype). Note that commands requiring a volume (such as efup:format)
   will fail if no volume list was loaded.

   Example: efup:fstab("/etc/efup.fstab")

efup:mount(<volume>)

   Mount the specified volume. The device and file-system type are determined
   from the previously parsed fstab file (see efup:fstab).

   Example: efup:mount("/data")

efup:run(<script>)

   Load the specified LUA script from the current update source (see
   efup:source) and execute it.

   Example: efup:run("download.lua")

efup:source(<source>)

   Specify the source for update files. Valid sources are local folders (e.g.,
   file:///mnt) or local zip files (e.g. file:///sdcard/update.zip). Local
   zip file sources may be signed and verified with efup:verify().

   Example: efup:source("file://update.zip")

efup:umount(<volume>)

   Unmount the specified volume. Only volumes from the previously parsed fstab
   file (see efup:fstab).

   Example: efup:umount("/data")

efup:verify()

   Verify the signature of the current source. At present, this is only
   supported for local zip file sources. See the Signing section of this
   document for details on signing update zip files.

   Example: efup:verify()

Signing
-------

Update files may be packaged into an smime'd zip file

    $ openssl smime -passin pass:abcdefg -binary \
        -sign -signer self.cert -inkey self.privkey \
        -in unsigned-update.zip -out signed-update.zip \
        -outform DER -nodetach

and verified with:

    efup:source("file://signed-update.zip")
    efup:verify()

Implementation Notes
--------------------

The NSPR and NSS libraries are included in this source tree to support
Android systems. When building for Linux, the autoconf script will check
if they are found and otherwise build the in-tree versions.

Signing messages with SMIME results in bytes being prepended and appended
to the message. For zip files, the decompression code consequently needs
to skip the leading bytes (searching for the first ZIP entry) and search
for the central directory normally located at the end of the file. While
the included libzip could handle the latter just fine, modifications were
required to search the actual start of the ZIP archive and apply that
offset when seeking within the archive for ZIP entries. The zip libary
will search for the archive start and for the central directory within the
first and last 64Kb of the input file.
