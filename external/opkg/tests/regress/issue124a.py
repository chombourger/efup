# Issue 124, reported by muusclaus
#
# This is an additional test case for issue 124 to cover the case where multiple
# packages depend on a common package with version constraints which change
# during an upgrade. The initial bugfix correctly handled the case with a single
# dependent but with multiple dependent packages it became impossible to upgrade
# any of them. This test case has been added to ensure that the final bugfix
# allows all the packages to be upgraded together.
