# Issue 124, reported by muusclaus
#
# Install package 'a' version 1.0 which depends on package 'b' version 1.0. Then
# make available 'a' version 1.1 which depends on 'b' version 1.1. Attempt to
# upgrade 'b' to version 1.1.
#
# The upgrade should be blocked as the installed version of 'a' (1.0) depends
# explictly on 'b' version 1.0 and this dependency is not satisfied by 'b'
# version 1.1.
