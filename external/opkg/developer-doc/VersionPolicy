opkg Version Policy
===================

Prior to a stable v1.0.0 release, the opkg verison policy shall be:

- 0.x.y releases
    - Increment y for releases including bugfixes and minor new features only.
      Tests and documentation may be expanded. Backwards comparability should be
      maintained.
    - Increment x for releases including major new features. Backwards
      compatibility may be broken but only with good reasons which should be
      clearly documented.

For opkg, the public API is the opkg program (and its command line
arguments), the configuration options, the API of libopkg and the on-disk
structures of package files, status and control files, etc.

The format of on-disk data structures (package files, status and control files,
etc) should be preserved much more carefully and should not be changed without
very strong reasons. If such a change is made, an upgrade path needs to be
offered to users.
